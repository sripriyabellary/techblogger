            <p class="text">Although first founded as an academic discipline in the 1950s, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is really starting to gain momentum. If you fancy yourself helping shape the future of all humans, AI is where you can make an impact. And according to Indeed, the demand for talent and the cash to pay for it is certainly there.</p>
            <p class="text">
                One approach to AI, called Machine Learning, specializes in helping computers learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions without the need for constant programming. It’s being applied to everything from self-driving cars and content recommendations, to healthcare and the environment.</p>

            </h3>
            <p class="text">Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of Electronics & Communication, computer science and engineering. Robotics involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans.</p>
            <p class="text">The development of robotics has been driven by the need for automated systems that can perform tasks without human intervention, as well as by the desire to replicate the abilities and intelligence of the human mind. This has led to the creation of a wide variety of robots, from simple machines that can perform repetitive tasks to highly advanced robots that can think and learn.</p>

            <p class="text">Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It's a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments.</p>
            <p class="text">Most cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, a networking protocol through which computers can work together to keep a shared, tamper-proof record of transactions. The challenge in a blockchain network is in making sure that all participants can agree on the correct copy of the historical ledger.</p>

            </h3>
            <p class="text">Mobile application development is the process of making software for smartphones, tablets and digital assistants, most commonly for the Android and iOS operating systems. The software can be preinstalled on the device, downloaded from a mobile app store or accessed through a mobile web browser. The programming and markup languages used for this kind of software development include Java, Swift, C# and HTML5.</p>
            <p class="text">Mobile app development is rapidly growing. From retail, telecommunications and e-commerce to insurance, healthcare and government, organizations across industries must meet user expectations for real-time, convenient ways to conduct transactions and access information.</p>

            </h3>
            <p class="text">Augmented reality (AR) is the integration of digital information with the user's environment in real time. Unlike virtual reality (VR), which creates a totally artificial environment, AR users experience a real-world environment with generated perceptual information overlaid on top of it.</p>
            <p class="text">Augmented reality is used to either visually change natural environments in some way or to provide additional information to users. The primary benefit of AR is that it manages to blend digital and three-dimensional (3D) components with an individual's perception of the real world. AR has a variety of uses, from helping in decision-making to entertainment.</p>

            <p class="text">Alexa is a voice assistant from Amazon. It is integrated into smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Echo Dot. As well as into Echo Show and Echo Spot devices. Those devices can provide a different kind of information by a voice request. The examples are news, weather, playing music and even shop online.Amazon allows developing custom skills for the Alexa which makes the technology more attractive.</p>
            <p class="text">Skills are some sort of applications which can be used by Echo devices. To use those skills a person should say a wake-up word and activate the skill. All the interaction with the skill is happening by voice.</p>
